# 🤖 MarginFi AI Assistant

An intelligent chatbot designed to help users navigate MarginFi's platform and understand DeFi concepts. Powered by GPT-4 and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), this AI assistant provides context-aware, real-time responses with a sleek, modern interface.

> **📝 Note:** RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) enhances the AI's responses by pulling relevant information from MarginFi's documentation in real-time. This means the chatbot provides accurate, up-to-date answers specific to MarginFi's platform, rather than relying solely on GPT-4's general knowledge.
